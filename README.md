1. Upon opening, go to settings.
2. I recommend setting in the preferences to prevent the bot from entering trades beyond -1%.
3. Add the exchange account, it supports almost all cryptocurrency exchanges.
4. The bot autonomously determines which cryptocurrency to trade.
With this bot, I turned $100 into $7000 in just a couple of days.

Detailed installation guide for this software is available on my Telegram:
